Log backups should be stored on a different storage system than the primary storage. The storage system that is used for the data backup can also be used for the log backup.

At the secondary storage, a volume needs to be configured to hold the log backups. Ensure that automatic Snapshot copies are switched off for this volume.

. Mount the volume at each database node, either by running the mount command or editing the file system table (fstab) file.
