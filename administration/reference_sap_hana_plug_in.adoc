The SAP HANA plug-in enables you to create backups and perform point-in-time recovery of SAP HANA databases based on storage Snapshot copies.

This plug-in uses the SAP HANA hdbsql client to execute SQL commands to provide database consistency and to manage the SAP HANA backup catalog. The plug-in is supported for both SAP Certified Hardware Appliances and Tailored Datacenter Integration (TDI) programs.

The plug-in is installed as part of the Snap Creator Agent on a host that has access to the SAP HANA database nodes.
