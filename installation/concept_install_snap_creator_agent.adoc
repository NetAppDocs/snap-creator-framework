You can install the Snap Creator Agent on Windows and UNIX hosts.

IMPORTANT: Although installing and running multiple agents on a single host is allowed, the best practice is to use a single agent per host.

If you plan to use the IBM Domino plug-in, the plug-in requires Snap Creator Agent to be installed in a location other than the Domino data folder.
