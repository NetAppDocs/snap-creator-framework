= Self-signed SSL certificate not matching the URL
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

* *Issue*
+
The self-signed SSL certificate provided with Snap Creator Framework does not match the URL.

* *Cause*
+
The common name (CN) of the SSL certificate presented on the Snap Creator service is for a different machine, and so it does not match the host name.

* *Corrective action*
+
System IP parameter has been introduced during the installation of Snap Creator Server and Snap Creator Agent to resolve host name.

 .. Enter the system IP address on which Snap Creator Framework is being installed in the System IP option.
  *** The common name of the SSL certificate can be created using the same IP address.
