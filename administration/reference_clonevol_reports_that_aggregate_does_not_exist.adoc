[.lead]
For clustered Data ONTAP, the aggregate must be assigned to the storage virtual machine (SVM) for cloning purposes. If not, the cloneVol action might return an error.

* *Issue*
+
The cloneVol action returns an error similar to following example:
+
----
ERROR: com.netapp.snapcreator.storage.executor.ZapiExecutorException: netapp.manage.NaAPIFailedException: Aggregate [aggregate name] does not exist (errno=14420)
----

* *Cause*
+
The aggregate was not assigned to the SVM for cloning purposes.

* *Corrective action*
+
Assign the aggregate to the SVM for cloning purposes: vserver modify -vserver [vserver_name] -aggr-list [aggregate_name]
