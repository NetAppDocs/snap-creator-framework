If you are going to install the Snap Creator Agent on a UNIX operating system (AIX, Linux, and Solaris), for the IBM Domino plug-in to work properly, three symbolic links (symlinks) must be created to link to Domino's shared object files.

Installation procedures vary slightly depending on the operating system. Refer to the appropriate procedure for your operating system.

NOTE: Domino does not support the HP-UX operating system.
