. Deactivate the SnapVault relationship.
+
NOTE: This step is only required with clustered Data ONTAP.
+
If you need to restore a Snapshot copy that is older than the Snapshot copy currently used as the base Snapshot copy for SnapVault, you must first deactivate the SnapVault relationship in clustered Data ONTAP. To do that, execute the following commands on the backup cluster console:
+
----
hana::> snapmirror quiesce -destination-path hana2b:backup_hana_data
Operation succeeded: snapmirror quiesce for destination hana2b:backup_hana_data.

hana::> snapmirror delete -destination-path hana2b:backup_hana_data
Operation succeeded: snapmirror delete the relationship with destination hana2b:backup_hana_data.

hana::> snapmirror release -destination-path hana2b:backup_hana_data
