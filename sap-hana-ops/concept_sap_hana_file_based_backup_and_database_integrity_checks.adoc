SAP recommends combining storage-based Snapshot backups with a weekly file-based backup to execute a block integrity check. The block integrity check can be executed from within the Snap Creator graphical user interface (GUI) or command line interface (CLI).

The File-Based Data Backup operation is used when the backup copies of files are to be retained. The Database Integrity Checks operation is used when backup copies have to be discarded.

You can configure either one or both of the operations. During on demand backup, you can choose either one of the operations.
