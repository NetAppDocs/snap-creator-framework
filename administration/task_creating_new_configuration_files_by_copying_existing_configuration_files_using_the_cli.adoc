Using the command-line interface (CLI), you can create a new configuration file by copying an existing configuration file, and then renaming the new file.

. Switch to the configuration directory: cd install_path/scServer4.3/engine/configs
. Copy the source configuration file: cp source_profile_name/configuration_nametarget_profile_name/new_configuration_name
+
You must provide a name for the new configuration file.

. Customize the new configuration file for use with the application or database that you want to manage.
