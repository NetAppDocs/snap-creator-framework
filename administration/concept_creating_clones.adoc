There are two methods for cloning volumes or LUNS: from a new backup and from an existing backup.

* Creating a clone from a new backup consists of taking a Snapshot, cloning the new Snapshot copy, and then mounting the cloned copy.
* Creating a clone from an existing backup consists of cloning an existing Snapshot copy, and then mounting the cloned copy.
