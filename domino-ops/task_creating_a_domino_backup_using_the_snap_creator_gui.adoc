You should back up your databases as soon as they are available in NetApp storage. You can schedule recurring backups after the initial backup.

You should have created the configuration file for the backup, as described in xref:task_using_the_gui_to_create_a_configuration_file.adoc[Creating a configuration file].

. In the Profiles and Configurations pane, select the configuration file and click *Actions* > *Backup*.
. In the Additional Parameters dialog box, select the policy for the backup job in the *Policy* drop-down and click *OK*.
