You can upgrade from Snap Creator 4.3.x, including all currently available patch releases.

The upgrade procedure is the same for Snap Creator Framework 4.1.x and 4.3.x.

NOTE: If you upgrade Snap Creator Framework 4.3.1 to a 4.3.1 patch release, you must omit the final step of running the java -jar snapcreator.jar -upgrade command.
