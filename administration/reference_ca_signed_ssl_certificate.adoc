= CA-signed SSL certificate is required for Snap Creator Framework
:icons: font
:imagesdir: ../media/

* *Issue*
+
The Certificate Authority (CA)-signed SSL certificate is required for Snap Creator Framework.

* *Cause*
+
The server's X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.

* *Corrective action*
+
Snap Creator Framework supports installation of a third-party certificate.

 .. Update the following parameter values in the snapcreator.properties and agent.properties files:
+
snapcreator.properties file:
+
SNAPCREATOR_KEYSTORE_PASS
+
SNAPCREATOR_KEYSTORE_PATH
+
agent.properties file:
+
KEYSTORE_FILE
+
KEYSTORE_PASS

 .. Restart the server and the agent services.
