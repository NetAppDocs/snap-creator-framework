Before you deploy the IBM Domino plug-in, make sure that your storage system and hosts meet minimum resource requirements. You also need to configure storage system layouts for databases, and optionally set up SnapMirror and SnapVault relationships.

For Snap Creator Server and Agent installation requirements, see the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMP12395424[Snap Creator Framework 4.1.2 Installation Guide]. Pay particular attention to the IBM Domino preinstallation requirements for the Agent host:

* On UNIX hosts, you must create symbolic links to IBM Domino shared object files.
* On Windows hosts, you must add the IBM Domino installation path to the PATH environment variable.
