Common Snap Creator errors fall into two categories: generic Snap Creator errors and Domino plug-in-specific errors. Domino plug-in-specific errors typically involve preinstallation issues, bad databases, or problems with a custom restore action.

NOTE: For information about generic Snap Creator errors, see the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMP12395422[Snap Creator Framework 4.1.2 Administration Guide].

== Domino plug-in is not supported on this platform

You typically receive this error when the prerequisites for the Domino plug-in have not been met. Generally, the error message is similar to the following:

----
Failed to load plug-in domino. Reason: ERROR: [ltd-00009] Domino plug-in
couldn't be loaded. Reasons could be 1) Domino plug-in is not supported
on this platform.
----

The following error message has also been known to appear:

----
ERROR: [tampico:9090(4.1.x)] SCF-00038: Application quiesce for
plug-in [domino] failed with exit code [99], continuing with backup.
----

As well as this one:

----
ERROR: [scf-00094] Application environment set for plug-in domino failed
[ERROR: [scf-00060] unknown application object [app] / application domino at snapcreator.pl line 6410.
----

These errors messages appear if one of the following conditions is not met:

* Preinstallation steps were not performed or were performed incorrectly:
 ** On UNIX hosts, you must create symbolic links to IBM Domino shared object files.
 ** On Windows hosts, you must add the IBM Domino installation path to the PATH environment variable.
For more information, see the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMP12395424[Snap Creator Framework 4.1.2 Installation Guide].
* The bit level of Domino is different from the bit level of Snap Creator. For example, if you are using 32-bit Domino, you should use 32-bit Snap Creator.

== Snap Creator backup fails because of a bad database

By default, a backup operation will fail if one or more databases are in an inconsistent or corrupted state. You can force the plug-in to proceed with backup operations despite errors, as described in step link:task_using_the_gui_to_create_a_configuration_file.md#STEP_AA41331683A24598B7845367CB967F99[task_using_the_gui_to_create_a_configuration_file.md#STEP_AA41331683A24598B7845367CB967F99].

== Domino restore using custom action fails

Restore errors typically occur when restore paths are not set correctly. Check the paths for extra characters and backslashes. Also, verify that the Data Restore Directory is set correctly.

Errors are similar to the following:

----
