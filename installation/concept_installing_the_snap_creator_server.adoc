You can install the Snap Creator Server on Windows and UNIX hosts.

In a typical installation, the Snap Creator Server and the Snap Creator Agent are installed on separate hosts. However, in some instances, the Server and Agent can be installed at the same time. In this setup, only the Server is configured during the installation.
