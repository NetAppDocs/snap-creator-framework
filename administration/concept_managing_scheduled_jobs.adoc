You can manage scheduled jobs by creating them (to automate backup operations), as well list as by editing, listing, running, and deleting those scheduled jobs.

The Snap Creator Server contains a centralized scheduler that allows Snap Creator jobs to be scheduled, either through a policy schedule (part of Policy Objects) or by being created directly through the scheduler. The scheduler can run up to 10 jobs concurrently and can queue additional jobs until a running job completes.
