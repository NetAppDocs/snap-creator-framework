If you are using a local retention policy (located in the configuration file), you can use the Snap Creator graphical user interface (GUI) scheduler to create schedules and run tasks. The scheduler--which is contained within Snap Creator Server--can schedule backups (Snapshot copies), LUN clones, volume clones, application-defined clones, Open Systems SnapVault (OSSV) transfers, archive jobs, and custom actions.

If you plan to use policy objects instead of a local retention policy, you should skip this procedure and create a policy schedule instead.

. From the main menu of the Snap Creator GUI, select *Management* > *Schedules* and click *Create*.
. In the New Job window, enter the details for the job.
