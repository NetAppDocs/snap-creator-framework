Achieve fast integration using modular architecture and policy-based automation.

* Cloud readiness
+
An operating system-independent Snap Creator functionality that supports physical and virtual platforms, and interoperates with IT-as-a-service and cloud environments.

* Cloning capability
+
Space-efficient data cloning is supported for development and testing purposes.
