The selected log can also be downloaded by clicking *Download Selected Log*. The downloaded log file is stored in the directory (or folder) that is specified by the browser for downloads.

NOTE: The out, debug, stderr, and agent logs are retained as defined by the LOG_NUM value in the configuration file, but the error log is always appended.
