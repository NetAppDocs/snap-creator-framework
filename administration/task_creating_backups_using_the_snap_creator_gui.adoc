You can create backups by using the Snap Creator GUI.

One of the following conditions must be met:

* A backup policy must be defined in the configuration file; or,
* A policy object must be configured and assigned to the profile.
+
NOTE: If a policy object is defined, it will overrule any entries that might be in the configuration file.

. From the Snap Creator GUI main menu, select *Management* > *Configurations*.
. From the *Configurations* tab, in the *Profiles and Configuration* pane, select the configuration file.
. Select *Actions* > *Backup*.

. In the Additional Parameters dialog box, select the policy, and then click *OK* to start the backup.
+
NOTE: If no user-created policy is assigned to the configuration, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly are the available selections in the *Policy* drop-down list. If one or more user-created policies have been assigned to the configuration, they are displayed in the *Policy* drop-down list instead.

. Verify that information about the backup job is displayed in the *Console* pane.

In this example, the output indicates that the Snap Creator operation finished successfully.

NOTE: The *Console* pane only displays the most pertinent information; this is the verbose mode. To see detailed information about the job that just ran, select *Reports* > *Logs* at the top of the page. From the Logs view, the profile, configuration file, log type, and specific log can be selected.
