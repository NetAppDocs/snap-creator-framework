If you are using VMware, KVM, and Xen plug-ins, you can perform application-defined restore operations by using the Snap Creator GUI.

In certain VMware environments, restore operations can take a long time. In such cases, you can either use the Snap Creator CLI or set up two agents: one for backup and the other for restore.

NOTE: VMware restore operations using the GUI are supported only for Snap Creator Agent.

. From the Snap Creator GUI main menu, select *Management* > *Configurations*.
. From the *Configurations* tab, in the Profiles and Configuration pane, select the configuration file.
. Select *Action* > *Restore*.
+
The Application Defined Restore dialog box is displayed in the right pane.

. Enter the restore details and click *OK*:
