In a UNIX environment, you might be unable to connect to the Snap Creator GUI; you must verify that certain conditions exist as you investigate the source of the problem.

* *Issue*
+
In a UNIX environment, you cannot connect to the Snap Creator GUI.

* *Corrective action*
+
Verify the following:

 ** The URL must start with HTTPS.
+
NOTE: If you use HTTP instead of HTTPS, the result will either be that there is nothing on the page or a "`?`" depending on the browser you use.

 ** The correct port number is used in the URL and that nothing else is already using the selected port.
+
You might try selecting a different port.

 ** Communication is allowed through the firewall of the operating system.
